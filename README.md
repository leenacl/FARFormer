# FARFormer

**FARFormer** is a consistency-driven progressive framework for robust multimodal semantic segmentation.

This repository serves as a placeholder for the FARFormer project.  
The implementation and trained models will be released after the acceptance of the corresponding paper.

## Overview

Multimodal semantic segmentation (e.g., RGB-D and RGB-T) in real-world environments often suffers from severe modality degradation and inconsistency.  
FARFormer addresses this challenge by introducing a progressive fusion framework that explicitly models consistency and difference across modalities, enabling robust feature learning under complex degradation conditions.

## Status

- 🔧 Code: under preparation  
- 📄 Paper: under review  
- 📦 Models: to be released
