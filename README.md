# FARFormer

**FARFormer** is a research project focusing on robust multimodal semantic segmentation under complex and degraded conditions.

This repository currently serves as an official placeholder for the FARFormer project.  
The implementation and pretrained models will be released after the acceptance of the corresponding paper.

## Background

In real-world environments such as underground mines, multimodal perception systems often suffer from severe data quality degradation.  
Such degradation is typically heterogeneous across modalities and varies spatially, making stable semantic segmentation particularly challenging.

FARFormer explores a consistency-oriented modeling strategy to improve robustness and generalization in multimodal semantic segmentation tasks, especially under complex degradation scenarios.
